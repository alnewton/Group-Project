        <h5> 1 1/4 cups cake flour </h5>
        <h5>  1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder </h5>
        <h5>  1/4 teaspoon salt </h5>
        <h5>  1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened </h5>
        <h5>  1/3 cup white sugar </h5>
        <h5>  1 large egg </h5>
        <h5>  1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract </h5>
        <h5>  1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk </h5>
        <h5>  1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut </h5>

        <h4> Icing: </h4>
        <h5> 1 cup confectioners' sugar </h5>
        <h5> 2 tablespoons passion fruit nectar </h5>
        <h5> 1 teaspoon heavy whipping cream </h5>
        <h5> 24 edible flowers (such as violets or pansies) </h5>


        <h3> Method </h3>
        <p>  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 mini muffin tins with mini paper liners.</p>

<p> 2. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl. Beat butter, white sugar, egg, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat flour mixture into creamed butter mixture, keeping mixer on low speed, until smooth. Add coconut milk and beat until batter is smooth; fold in shredded coconut. </p>

<p> 3. Spoon rounded tablespoons batter into prepared muffin cups. </p>

<p> 4. Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a rack to cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes. </p>

<p> 5. Mix confectioners' sugar, passion fruit nectar, and cream together in a small bowl until smooth. Dip tops of cupcakes into icing, letting excess drip off. Let icing set for 2 minutes; garnish with flowers. </p>
