          <img src="autumn mushroom risotto.jpg" width="400px">

          <h3> Ingredients </h3>
          <h5> 50g dried porcini mushrooms </h5>
          <h5> 1 vegetable stock cube </h5>
          <h5> 2 tbsp olive oil </h5>
          <h5> 1 onion, finely chopped </h5>
          <h5> 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped </h5>
          <h5> 250g pack chestnut mushrooms, chopped </h5>
          <h5> 300g risotto rice, such as arborio </h5>
          <h5> 1 x 175ml glass white wine </h5>
          <h5> 25g butter </h5>
          <h5> handful parsley leaves, chopped </h5>
          <h5> 50g parmesan or Grana Padano, freshly grated </h5>

      <h3> Method </h3>
          <ol>
            <li> Put 50g dried porcini mushrooms into a large bowl and pour over 1 litre boiling water.
              Soak for 20 mins, then drain into a bowl, discarding the last few tbsp of liquid left in the bowl. </li>

            <li> Crumble 1 vegetable stock cube into the mushroom liquid,
              then squeeze the mushrooms gently to remove any liquid. </li>

            <li> Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a shallow saucepan or deep frying pan over a medium flame.
                Add 1 finely chopped onion and 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, then fry for about 5 mins until soft.</li>

            <li> Stir in 250g chopped chestnut mushrooms and the dried mushrooms,
              season with salt and pepper and continue to cook for 8 mins until the fresh mushrooms have softened. </li>

            <li> Stir in 250g chopped chestnut mushrooms and the dried mushrooms,
              season with salt and pepper and continue to cook for 8 mins until the fresh mushrooms have softened. </li>

            <li> Keep the pan over a medium heat and pour in a quarter of the mushroom stock.
              Simmer the rice, stirring often, until the rice has absorbed all the liquid. </li>

            <li> Add about the same amount of stock again and continue to simmer and stir - it should start to become creamy, plump and tender.
              By the time the final quarter of stock is added, the rice should be almost cooked. </li>

            <li> Continue stirring until the rice is cooked. If the rice is still undercooked, add a splash of water.
              Take the pan off the heat, add 25g butter and scatter over 25g grated parmesan or Grana Padano cheese and half a handful of chopped parsley leaves. </li>

            <li> Cover and leave for a few mins so that the rice can take up any excess liquid as it cools a bit.
              Give the risotto a final stir, spoon into bowls and scatter with the remaining 25g grated cheese and the remaining chopped parsley leaves. </li>
          </ol>
