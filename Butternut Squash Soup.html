         <ul>INGREDIENTS</ul>
         <ul>1.5kg/3lb 5oz peeled and deseeded butternut squash, cut into 3cm/1¼in cubes</ul>
         <ul>1 large onion, roughly chopped</ul>
         <ul>2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</ul>
         <ul>1 red pepper, deseeded and cut into cubes</ul>
         <ul>4 tbsp olive oil</ul>
         <ul>1 tbsp clear honey (optional)</ul>
         <ul>5cm/2in piece fresh root ginger, peeled and chopped</ul>

           <ul>INSTRUCTIONS</ul>
           <ul>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Tip the prepared squash into a large, resealable freezer bag with the onion, carrots and red pepper. Add half the oil and salt and pepper and toss everything together until the vegetables are evenly coated. Tip into a large roasting tin and spread out to form a single layer. Roast in the oven for 40–45 minutes, or until tender and tinged brown. Drizzle over the honey, if using, 5 minutes before the end of cooking. Place the large, deep-sided saucepan over a medium heat, add the remaining oil and, when it is hot, add the ginger and fry for a minute. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil, then stir in the roasted vegetables and add salt and pepper. Remove the saucepan from the heat and, using a hand blender, blend the mixture until smooth. Return to the heat to warm through and serve hot with crusty bread.</ul>
