INSTRUCTIONS
Combine cooked millet*, 2% milk, vanilla, and salt in a small saucepan and slowly heat over low heat until it reaches scalding temperature, which is 180ºF. Basically, you'll be heating it until it's about to start simmering. If you see any signs of a simmer or a boil starting, immediately remove the pot from the heat. You can also heat the millet and milk in the microwave, on high, in a microwave safe bowl, in one minute increments until it's heated through.
While the cereal is heating, prepare the brown sugar bourbon pear topping. Place butter and brown sugar in a pan over medium heat. Cook while stirring frequently until it begins to bubble, and then add a splash of bourbon. Simmer the bourbon for one minute while continuously stirring in order to cook the alcohol off. Finally, add the pears and the walnuts to the pan and continue heating until it returns to a simmer, then remove from the heat.
Divide the hot millet between 2 bowls and serve topped with the brown sugar bourbon pears. Serve immediately.
